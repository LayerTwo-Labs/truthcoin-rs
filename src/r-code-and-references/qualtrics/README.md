<h2>Qualtrics Demo</h2>

I just begain this now, the directories should work, but no guarantees.  

This (the functions in QualtrixBridge.Rmd) allows someone to:  
1. Use a .csv input of questions (SurveyInputs.csv) to produce a qualtrics survey (ToQualtrics.txt which is imported into Qualtrics).  
2. Then, someone can administer the survey.  
3. Then, someone can get the results of the survey (FromQualtrics.csv) and put the results back in here.  
4. Finally, one can use the results to get the SVD results (output\agents.csv, output\decisions.csv) and a Cool Plot representing them (plot.svg).
